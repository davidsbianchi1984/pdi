"""A 422 is a list, and no client could show a person a list.

## The finding

0.30.0 put every refusal this product raises into the reader's language.
0.30.1 caught the one it had missed — `RequestValidationError`, the 422 a
mistyped form produces, which went out past the handler carrying pydantic's
`input` key — and translated its `msg` too.

Nobody looked at what a client does with the result. `detail` on a 422 is a
*list* of rows, and every one of this product's four client families rendered
it by a path written for a string:

* the console called `JSON.stringify` on it, so the note under the form read
  `[{"type":"missing","loc":["body","display_name"],"msg":"Field required"}]`;
* Android's `JSONObject.optString("detail")` coerces a `JSONArray` through
  `toString()`, producing the same thing;
* iOS asked for `as? String`, got `nil`, and fell back to `HTTP 422`;
* Windows called `GetString()` on an array element, which throws, was caught,
  and fell back to `HTTP 422`.

        asked     is the refusal translated
        mattered  is the refusal a sentence

The `msg` translated in 0.30.1 was correct, arrived, and was never read by
anybody: it sat inside a JSON blob, or was discarded for a status code. Two of
the four families showed the person *less* than before their language was
considered at all.

## What this checks

The sentence is composed on the server (`i18n.validation_message`) rather than
in each client, for the reason the refusal handler is one handler: four
renderings of one thing are four chances to render it differently, and three of
these have no test runner in this repository.

So the driven half below holds the server to composing it, translating it, and
— the part that matters most — putting nothing in it that is not already in
the rows. The structural half holds each client to *reading* it, which is all a
source-level check can honestly claim; see
`test_native_shells_record_nothing_private.py` for the same limit stated the
same way.

## What is still not right

The field name in the sentence is the API's name — `name`, not the
label the form shows. It is joined with an em dash rather than declined into
the sentence, so nothing reads as half-translated, but a person looking at a
field captioned *"Nome de exibição"* is told about `name`. Mapping the
two needs a per-client table that does not exist. Written down here rather than
guessed at.

# still broken: `message` is a field on a model, a parameter name on an
# exception class, and a word in the comments directly above the bug.
#
# The second anchored on the throw and asked whether the surrounding lines read
# `message`. That caught the three shells and still passed on a broken console,
# because this console's fallback chain has always read `body.message` as an
# *alternative to* `detail` — so the words were present in a window where the
# sentence was being dropped on the floor.
#
#     asked     does the decode mention the sentence
#     mattered  does the decode consult the sentence first
#
# So the console is checked on the two things that actually carry it: that it
# extracts the sentence at all, and that the extracted sentence is the first
# operand of the fallback. Either one removed and a 422 renders as a list.
