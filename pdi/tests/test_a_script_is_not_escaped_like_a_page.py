"""A script is not escaped like a page.

`_js_literal` builds the JSON and JavaScript string literals this product's
landing pages drop inside a `<script>` element — including the translated
string table. It called `html.escape`, which is the right tool for a page and
the wrong one for a script: **a browser does not decode HTML entities inside a
script element**, so escaping there protects nothing and corrupts the value.

    asked     is the value escaped
    mattered  is it escaped for the place it lands

`Terms & Conditions` reached the reader as `Terms &amp; Conditions`, in every
language that ships.

The page was safe, but by accident rather than by its own mechanism. Its
docstring named the real hazard correctly — a literal `</script` ends the
element whatever the JavaScript quoting says — and the line written to stop
it, `.replace("</", "<\\/")`, sat *after* an `html.escape` that had already
turned `<` into `&lt;`. It never matched anything and never could.

These hold both halves: the value survives intact, and nothing that reaches
the page can close the script element.
