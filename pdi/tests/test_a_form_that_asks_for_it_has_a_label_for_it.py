"""A recorded field stops being recordable the day a form asks for it.

`pdi/tests/field_labels_unmapped.txt` records 51 request-model fields that keep
their identifiers in a 422, and gives a good reason:

    These are the rest: enum members a control sets, ids a client fills in
    from the resource it is already looking at, and flags a switch owns. A 422
    naming one of them is a client bug rather than something a person
    mistyped.

Every word of that is a claim about **the screens**, and nothing in this
repository was reading the screens. The ceiling stops the list growing; it is
silent about a field already on the list that a screen quietly grew an input
for. The record would go on shrinking, every test would stay green, and the
field would sit there being typed into a box by a person and named by an
identifier in the refusal underneath it.

That is not hypothetical here of all places. This record's own header says a
0.46.4 sweep found **forty** rows with a control on a form and no label beside
it — five bare selects, eight boxes carrying only a placeholder, a date input
with nothing at all. That sweep was somebody reading every screen by hand, and
when it finished, nothing was left behind to notice the forty-first. QRME's
copy of this record then carried `weight` and `aspect` while its blend screen
had been asking for both, in ten languages, for releases. This is that reading,
kept.

## How a form asking for something is recognised

Two conditions, and the AND is the whole guard:

* the field is **bound to a form control** — the `value` or the `onChange`
  target of an `<input>`, `<textarea>` or `<select>`;
* the field is **a key in an object literal** in the same screen, which is
  what being sent in a request body looks like from the source.

Either half alone is noise. Screens are full of object literals — inline
styles, component state, table rows — and control bindings alone match local
UI state that never leaves the browser. A field that is both is one a person
fills in and this API then validates, which is exactly the population
`_FIELD_LABELS` exists for.
