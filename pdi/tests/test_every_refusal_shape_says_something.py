"""Every refusal shape, not just the one that was broken last time.

## The finding

The round before this gave the 422 a top-level `message` and taught all four
clients to read it. `detail` has three shapes in this product — a **string**
for most refusals, a **dict** for the plan gate, a **list** for a 422 — and
only the list was fixed. The plan gate's `message` stayed nested inside its
dict, where it had always been, and `refuse` wraps that as
`{"detail": {...}}`.

    asked     does the sentence ride beside the structure
    mattered  does every structured refusal put it in the same place

The three native shells look for a top-level `message` and then for a string
`detail`. A dict is neither, so the plan gate — the one refusal that stands
between somebody and a decision to pay — rendered as the bare status code: no
price, no plan name, no reason.

iOS and Windows had always done that. Android had been coercing the dict
through `toString()` and showing its raw JSON — ugly, but it contained the
price — and teaching it to read the top-level key first is what regressed it
to the status code.

## What this checks

Per *shape* rather than per route, because that is the axis the defect lives on
and the axis nothing was testing. `i18n.refuse` lifts the sentence for every
shape now, so a refusal added later cannot forget to.
