"""The refusals that could not be keyed, and the slot that could ruin them.

`tests/refusals_untranslated.txt` has carried this for three releases:
f-string refusals, named as uncovered and deliberately not counted, because

    f"language must be one of {', '.join(SUPPORTED)}"

cannot be looked up by its English source — at the moment it is raised there is
no English source, only a result.

    asked     is the refusal a constant we can translate
    mattered  is every part of it something we can translate

`i18n.Templated` carries the template and its slots alongside the finished
English sentence, so `localize_detail` can refill the frame in the reader's
language. It is a `str`, and its value is that English sentence, so nothing
that already treats a detail as text needed to change.

## The slot is the whole design

A translated frame around an English slot is *worse* than an English sentence:
it reads as a bug, in front of somebody who is already being told no. So a slot
holding whitespace — prose, in any language — sets `translatable = False` and
the whole refusal stays English, which is the state it was already in, now
chosen rather than stumbled into.

The known limit: a *single* English word has no whitespace either. QRME's copy
of this mechanism carries a `Term` marker and a translated vocabulary for the
closed sets its refusals interpolate; PDI has no refusal that
interpolates one, and `test_no_slot_is_filled_from_a_string_literal` fails if
that stops being true.

## What this file does not claim

4 sites are converted. 5 f-string refusals remain, and the
record now names the reason per site rather than "f-string".
