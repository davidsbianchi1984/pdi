"""Offline mode: the zero-internet guarantee, enforced rather than assumed.

Set ``PDI_OFFLINE=1`` and nothing this product sends may leave the machine or
its own network.

A vault is the one product in this family where that promise is the whole
point, and it had no way to make it: ``notify.py``, ``qrme_client.py`` and
``client.py`` each open a connection and none of them had a flag to consult.

    asked     is the data encrypted at rest
    mattered  can anything carry it off the host

## Local is the test, not silence

Offline means *nothing leaves the machine*, not *nothing opens a socket*. A
sibling product on the LAN, a webhook on the same network, are on this side of
the wire. Refusing those outright would break an on-prem deployment that is
already exactly what offline mode is for.

    are all on the same side of the wire: an Ollama daemon on loopback, the
    on-prem PDI vault, an escalation webhook on the LAN. Two of those were

    assumptions about how somebody would deploy, written as if they were
    properties of the code.

        mattered  is every network path

    Blanket refusal would also have been wrong in a way that matters: it would
    have silenced the escalation webhook, and this product's own plan-gate
    refusal promises in nine languages that emergency paths are never affected.
