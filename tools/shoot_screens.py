"""Photograph the console — the real one, running, not a drawing of it.

## Why this exists

`docs/screens/` filled up with hand-drawn SVG mockups of every surface, and
the README gallery presented them as what the product looks like. They were
illustrations. The owner's words, in a sibling product, on finding a
faceless mannequin in the gallery:

    "those screens you will never see that you have created. They never
     rendered that way. Only actual snapshots of what the application
     looks like."

He is right, and the failure is worse than cosmetic: a drawing captioned as
a product is a claim about the product. Asked to *grab* screens, the answer
was to draw them — the difference between a photograph and a painting,
presented as if it were the former.

    asked     show the product on the front page
    mattered  show the product, not a picture of what it was meant to be

So this harness does the honest thing. It starts the real backend, serves
the real built console from it, enrols a real account through the real
door, walks the real tabs, and photographs what the browser actually shows.

## What it does NOT do

It does not invent. A surface that will not render — because it needs a
device, a camera, a second person in a room — is left alone rather than
mocked up. An empty state photographed honestly is worth more than a
populated one that never existed.

## The check that makes it evidence

The sibling's version of this navigated by URL hash, which this console
does not use for tabs either: `App.tsx` holds the tab in `useState` and the
only thing that moves it is a press in the sidebar. A harness that
navigates by a mechanism the product does not have fails silently and
writes confident, wrong files — worse than the drawings it replaces,
because a drawing is obviously a drawing and this looks like evidence.

So it presses the real sidebar button and then **checks** that the item the
console marks `active` is the one it asked for. If it is not, nothing is
written. A missing screen is a gap somebody notices; a wrong screen is a
gap nobody notices.

Run it with ``python tools/shoot_screens.py`` from the repository root,
with ``app/dist`` built (``npm run build`` in ``app/``).
